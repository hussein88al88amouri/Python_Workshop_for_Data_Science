    "### 1.2.3. Introduction to interactive coding\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides an interactive mode, commonly referred to as a Python shell or REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), \n",
    "which allows you to execute Python code line by line and see the immediate results. This mode is useful for testing code\n",
    "snippets, experimenting with language features, and performing quick calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Launching the Python Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "To launch the Python shell, open a command prompt or terminal and enter the python command. \n",
    "This will start the Python interpreter and display a prompt indicating that you can enter Python code. \n",
    "Depending on your system, you may need to use python3 command to launch the Python 3 interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Executing Python statements interactively\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the Python shell is launched, you can start entering Python statements and expressions, and the interpreter will execute them immediately. For example, you can try entering simple mathematical expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> 2 + 3  # Output: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> 10 / 2  # Output: 5.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also define variables, create functions, and execute more complex code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = 5\n",
    ">>> y = 2 * x + 3\n",
    ">>> y  # Output: 13\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def square(n):\n",
    "...     return n ** 2\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> square(4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exiting the Python Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "To exit the Python shell, you can use the exit() or quit() function or press the appropriate key combination for your operating \n",
    "system (such as Ctrl+Z or Ctrl+D).\n",
    "\n",
    "By running Python in interactive mode, you have a convenient way to test code, experiment with different ideas, \n",
    "and get immediate feedback. It's a valuable tool for learning and exploring Python's features and capabilities\n"
